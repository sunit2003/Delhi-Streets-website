    <p>chillies are the main or very crucial part of every dish that you eat
       Specially in delhi the dish without chilly is not a complete dish.
       Chilies, known for their fiery flavor and vibrant hue, play an indispensable role in the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine. 
       In countless Indian dishes, chilies are used to impart a tantalizing heat that stimulates the taste buds and elevates the overall experience.
       From the scorching green chilies of the North to the fiery red chilies of the South, each region has its own unique love affair with these spicy gems. 
       In iconic dishes like the Punjabi favorite or the fiery Vindaloo from Goa, chilies infuse depth and character. 
       The aromatic spice blends of garam masala and curry powder are incomplete without the addition of chili powder or fresh green chilies. 
       Whether it's the famous street food, Chaat, or the renowned biryanis, chilies hold a significant position, enhancing the flavors and adding a delightful kick.
